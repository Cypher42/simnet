@article{Ikonomovska2015optiontrees,
	abstract = {The emergence of ubiquitous sources of streaming data has given rise to the popularity of algorithms for online machine learning. In that context, Hoeffding trees represent the state-of-the-art algorithms for online classification. Their popularity stems in large part from their ability to process large quantities of data with a speed that goes beyond the processing power of any other streaming or batch learning algorithm. As a consequence, Hoeffding trees have often been used as base models of many ensemble learning algorithms for online classification. However, despite the existence of many algorithms for online classification, ensemble learning algorithms for online regression do not exist. In particular, the field of online any-time regression analysis seems to have experienced a serious lack of attention. In this paper, we address this issue through a study and an empirical evaluation of a set of online algorithms for regression, which includes the baseline Hoeffding-based regression trees, online option trees, and an online least mean squares filter. We also design, implement and evaluate two novel ensemble learning methods for online regression: online bagging with Hoeffding-based model trees, and an online RandomForest method in which we have used a randomized version of the online model tree learning algorithm as a basic building block. Within the study presented in this paper, we evaluate the proposed algorithms along several dimensions: predictive accuracy and quality of models, time and memory requirements, bias–variance and bias–variance–covariance decomposition of the error, and responsiveness to concept drift.},
