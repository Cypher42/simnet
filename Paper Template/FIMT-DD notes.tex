FIMT DD: 
  - Dataset reqs:
     - High speed
     - continuous data
     - time streamed data
     - concept drift
     - Noisy
     - House price competition?
     - Use the data sets from org paper?
     
     
     
 - Issues:
     - requires many data points for convergence
     - parameters require a lot of testing 
     - Sth concept drift is either ignored or over-fitted / depending on parameter
     

- Ideas:
    - use a leaf node model that has massive issue with concept drift (RLS i.e.)
    - Thus leaf nodes are unable to adapt to drift, so drift detection is more  effective
    -Compare that to org paper--> need to add rec. E-BST pruning stuff
